# MyChessEngine
### About

MyChessEngine is my Summer 2024 project designed to deepen understanding of chess and to explore chess engine algorithms such as the MinMax algorithm and various weighting systems. This project serves as both an educational tool and a foundation for developing advanced chess algorithms.

To run the project, start the ChessGame.java module.

### Features
* Full Chess Functionality: Supports all standard chess rules, including castling, en passant, and pawn promotion.
* Game Management: Allows resetting the board and maintaining move histories to navigate back to previous moves.
* Evaluation System: Implements a raw metrics and evaluation system to lay the groundwork for future algorithm enhancements.
* Performance Metrics: Monitors CPU and memory usage to provide insights into the engine's performance.
  
### Future Work
* MinMax Algorithm: Integrate the MinMax algorithm for enhanced move decision-making.
* Alpha-Beta Pruning: Implement alpha-beta pruning to optimize the MinMax algorithm.
* Machine Learning: Explore machine learning techniques to improve the evaluation function.
